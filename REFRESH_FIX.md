# ðŸ”„ Page Refresh Fix - Multiplier & Game State Persistence

## Problem
When users refreshed the page during an active game round, the multiplier and all game state were lost, causing a poor user experience.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Game State Persistence**
Added automatic saving of critical game state to `sessionStorage`:
- Current multiplier value
- User's active bet amount
- Whether user has an active bet
- Current round phase (waiting/flying/crashed)
- Crash point for current round
- Timestamp of last save

### 2. **State Save Triggers**
Game state is saved automatically:
- When a new round starts
- When user places a bet
- Every ~1 second during flight (probabilistically)
- When multiplier increases

### 3. **State Restoration on Refresh**
On page load:
- Checks for saved game state in `sessionStorage`
- Validates state is less than 30 seconds old (prevents stale data)
- Restores multiplier, bet amount, and round phase
- Updates UI to reflect restored state
- Clears old state if expired

### 4. **State Cleanup**
- State is automatically cleared when round ends (crash or waiting phase)
- Expired states (>30 seconds) are ignored and removed
- Prevents conflicts between different rounds

## Key Features

âœ… **Seamless Refresh**: Users can refresh during a round and see the current multiplier
âœ… **Bet Protection**: Active bets are preserved across refresh
âœ… **Time Validation**: Only recent state (<30s) is restored
âœ… **Auto Cleanup**: Old states don't interfere with new rounds
âœ… **No Data Loss**: All critical game data persists

## Technical Details

**Storage Key**: `aviator_game_state` in `sessionStorage`

**Saved Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
    balance: number,
    bonusBalance: number,
    currentBet: number,
    multiplier: number,
    isPlaying: boolean,
    roundPhase: string,
    userHasBet: boolean,
    crashPoint: number,
    timestamp: number
}
```

**Functions Added**:
- `saveGameState()` - Saves current game state to sessionStorage
- `loadGameState()` - Restores game state on page load with validation

## User Experience Improvements

1. **During Flight**: If user refreshes while plane is flying, they see the current multiplier and can continue watching or cash out
2. **Active Bet**: Bet amount and potential win are restored
3. **Round Phase**: UI correctly shows if round is active or in countdown
4. **No Interruption**: Game continues seamlessly after refresh

## Notes

- Uses `sessionStorage` (cleared when browser tab closes)
- 30-second expiration prevents stale data issues
- Complements existing balance persistence in `localStorage`
- Works alongside statistics and trend tracking features
