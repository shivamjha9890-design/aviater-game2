## 📊 Complete Flow Example

### **Scenario: User Deposits ₹100**

**Step 1: User Makes Deposit Request**
```
User on game page → Opens wallet
Gaming Balance: ₹50 (signup bonus)
User: Deposit ₹100 with 200% bonus
Submits with UTR: ABC123456

Gaming Balance: Still ₹50 (waiting for approval)
```

**Step 2: Admin Approves Deposit**
```
You (Admin): Open superadmin panel
See deposit request: User XYZ, ₹100, UTR: ABC123456
Click "Approve"

What happens:
1. Database updated: User balance = ₹150, Bonus = ₹200
2. If user logged in → sessionStorage updated
3. Alert shows: "Deposit Approved! Gaming Balance: ₹350"
```

**Step 3: User Sees Update Automatically**
```
User is playing game (doesn't refresh)
After 5 seconds maximum:

→ Balance syncs from database
→ Gaming Balance updates: ₹50 → ₹350
→ Big notification appears:
   
   🎉
   Deposit Approved!
   +₹300
