## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Before (BUG):**

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### **Complete Flow Example:**

#### **1. User Deposits ₹1000**
```
User: Deposits ₹1000 via UPI
Admin: Approves deposit
User Gaming Balance: ₹1000
LocalStorage saved: ₹1000
```

#### **2. User Bets ₹10 (First Bet)**
```
Click "Place Bet ₹10"
→ Balance: ₹1000 - ₹10 = ₹990
→ SAVED TO DATABASE IMMEDIATELY ✅
→ Game starts
→ Plane flying...
```

**If user refreshes at this point:**
```
→ Page reloads
→ Balance loads from database = ₹990 ✅
→ Money is already gone, bet was placed
```

#### **3A. User LOSES (Plane Crashes)**
```
Plane crashes at 1.45x
→ User didn't cash out
→ ❌ LOST ₹10!
→ Balance stays: ₹990
→ SAVED TO DATABASE ✅
→ Money lost FOREVER
```

**After loss, if user refreshes:**
```
→ Balance = ₹990 ✅
→ Lost ₹10 is GONE forever
```

#### **3B. User WINS (Cashes Out at 2.5x)**
```
User clicks "Cash Out" at 2.5x
→ Win amount: ₹10 × 2.5 = ₹25
→ Balance: ₹990 + ₹25 = ₹1015
→ SAVED TO DATABASE ✅
→ Profit: +₹15
```

**After win, if user refreshes:**
```
→ Balance = ₹1015 ✅
→ Winnings are saved
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **What Was Fixed:**

#### **1. Immediate Balance Save on Bet Placement**
```javascript
// In placeBet() function - Line 259
function placeBet() {
    // Deduct bet from balance
    gameState.balance -= betAmount;
    
    // CRITICAL: Save balance immediately
    saveUserBalance(); // ← ADDED THIS!
    
    // Rest of code...
}
```

**Why?** So if user refreshes during game, bet is already deducted.

#### **2. Save Balance on Crash (Loss)**
```javascript
// In crash() function - Line 456
function crash() {
    // CRITICAL: Save balance - money is LOST FOREVER
    saveUserBalance(); // ← ADDED THIS!
    
    // Track wagering
    updateWageringProgress(0); // ← ADDED THIS!
    
    // Rest of code...
}
```

**Why?** So lost money is saved to database and never comes back.

#### **3. Wagering Tracks Losses Too**
```javascript
// In crash() function
updateWageringProgress(0); // 0 profit, but bet is tracked
```

**Why?** User's wager requirement counts ALL bets, not just wins.
