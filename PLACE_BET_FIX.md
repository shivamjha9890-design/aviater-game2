# 🐛 Place Bet Button Fix - Complete Solution

## ❌ Problems Found

The Place Bet button wasn't working due to **multiple sound system conflicts**:

1. **Line 231**: `sounds.play()` - function doesn't exist
2. **Lines 148-157**: References to removed audio elements (`sounds.bgMusic`, `sounds.tick`)
3. **Lines 286, 347, 418, 516**: Calls to removed engine sound functions
4. **Old sound system**: Still trying to use HTML audio elements that were removed

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### 1. **Fixed Bet Sound** (Line 231)
```javascript
// ❌ OLD - Caused crash
sounds.play();

// ✅ NEW - Works perfectly
GameSounds.playBetSound();
```

### 2. **Removed Old Sound Control**
Removed all references to:
- `sounds.bgMusic` (background music - removed)
- `sounds.tick` (HTML audio element - removed)
- `playSound()` function (obsolete)
- `stopSound()` function (obsolete)
- `speakAnnouncement()` (annoying feature)

### 3. **Removed Engine Sounds**
Deleted all calls to:
- `createEngineSound()` - Not needed
- `startEngineSound()` - Removed
- `varyEngineSound()` - Removed
- `stopEngineSound()` - Removed

These were creating errors and were annoying anyway.

### 4. **Fixed All Sound Calls**

**Bet Placement:**
```javascript
GameSounds.playBetSound(); // Gentle C note
```

**Crash:**
```javascript
GameSounds.playCrashSound(); // Soft descending tone
```

**Cash Out:**
```javascript
// Regular win
GameSounds.playCashoutSound();

// Big win (5x+ profit)
GameSounds.playBigWinSound();
```
