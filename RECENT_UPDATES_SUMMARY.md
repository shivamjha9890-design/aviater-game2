### Problem Solved
Users were losing game state (multiplier, active bets) when refreshing the page.

### What Was Fixed

  - Potential win calculation restored
  - Cash out button appears if bet is active

- **🎮 Game Phase Restoration**
  - Round phase (waiting/flying/crashed) saved
  - UI updates correctly after refresh
  - No interruption to gameplay

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `sessionStorage` for temporary state
- 30-second expiration prevents stale data
- Auto-cleanup when rounds end
- Time validation on restore

### Files Modified
- `script.js` - Added saveGameState() and loadGameState() functions
- `REFRESH_FIX.md` - Technical documentation

## Update 3: Global History System ✅

### What Changed
History is now **global and persistent** instead of user-specific.

### Key Features
- **🌐 Shared Across All Users**
  - Everyone sees the same 25-round trend
  - Creates authentic casino experience
  - New users see existing game history

- **♾️ Runs Forever**
  - History survives page refresh
  - Persists across browser sessions
  - Continues until localStorage cleared

- **🔄 Automatic Updates**
  - Saves after every round crash
  - Updates trend visualization in real-time
  - Maintains last 25 rounds only

### Before vs After

**Before:**
```
User A → Personal history → Lost on refresh
User B → Personal history → Lost on refresh
Different history per user
```

**After:**
```
User A → Global history → Persists on refresh
User B → Same global history → Persists on refresh
Shared experience for all users
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Global**: Round history (localStorage: `aviator_global_history`)
- **Personal**: Win/loss statistics (localStorage: user data)

### Files Modified
- `script.js` - Added saveGlobalHistory() and loadGlobalHistory()
- `GLOBAL_HISTORY_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive documentation
